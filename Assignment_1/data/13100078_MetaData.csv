1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics, Birth, Death and Stillbirth Databases. The table 13-10-0078-01 is an update of table 13-10-0407-01."
2,"Infant mortality corresponds to the death of a child under one year of age. Expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births."
3,"Perinatal deaths include late fetal deaths (stillbirths with a gestational age of 28 weeks or more) and early neonatal deaths (deaths of infants aged less than one week)."
4,"Numbers and rates in this table may differ from those found in similar data published by the Vital Statistics program as the data here have been tabulated based on postal codes available for place of residence."
5,"Health regions are administrative areas defined by provincial ministries of health according to provincial legislation. The health regions presented in this table are based on boundaries and names in effect as of December 2015. For complete Canadian coverage, each northern territory represents a health region."
6,"Peer groups are aggregations of health regions that share similar socio-economic and demographic characteristics, based on data from the 2011 Census of Population and 2011 National Household Survey. These are useful in the analysis of health regions, where important differences may be detected by comparing health regions within a peer group. The nine peer groups are identified by the letters A through I, which are appended to the health region 4-digit code. Caution should be taken when comparing data for the Peer Groups over time due to changes in the Peer Groups. In an analysis involving the peer groups, only one level of geography in Ontario should be used. For more information on the peer groups classification, consult Statistics Canada's publication ""Health Regions: Boundaries and Correspondence with Census Geography"" (catalogue number 82-402-X)."
7,"In Ontario, Public Health Units (PHU) administer health promotion and disease prevention programs. Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) are responsible for planning, funding and administering health care programs and services across the province. Data are provided for both PHUs and LHINs. However, since the weights for the Canadian Community Health Survey sample are primarily based on PHUs, only estimates for rates (percentages) are available by LHIN in the profile. Special LHIN weights are available upon request. These weights will allow for more precise estimation at the LHIN level including the estimation of totals."
8,"Counts and rates in this table are based on three consecutive years of data."
9,"The 95% confidence interval (CI) illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate."
10,"Wide confidence intervals (CIs) indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted and compared with due caution."
11,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, (...) for figures not applicable and (x) for figures suppressed to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act."
12,"The figures shown in the tables have been subjected to a confidentiality procedure known as controlled rounding to prevent the possibility of associating statistical data with any identifiable individual. Under this method, all figures, including totals and margins, are rounded either up or down to a multiple of 5. Controlled rounding has the advantage over other types of rounding of producing additive tables as well as offering more protection."
13,"2017 data for Yukon are not available."
14,"The number of births, stillbirths, and deaths in Ontario for 2016 and 2017 are considered preliminary."
15,"To avoid data suppression, northern regions in Saskatchewan have been grouped with neighbouring regions, as follows: Athabasca Health Authority (4713) is combined with Mamawetan Churchill River Regional Health Authority (4711) and Keewatin Yatthé Regional Health Authority (4712) and referred to as Mamawetan/Keewatin/Athabasca (4714)."
